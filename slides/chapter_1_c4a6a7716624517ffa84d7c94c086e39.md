## Retrieving and manipulating Twitter data

Now that you have connected to the Twitter API using the rtweet package in the previous lesson, let's dive straight into the fun part: how to retrieve and manipulate Twitter data.

## How is a tweet structured?

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "0cb7328509"
center_content: false
```

`@part1`
- **User name**: A unique identifier for each user. {{1}}
- **Time stamp**: The date and time when the tweet was generated. {{2}}
- **Text**: The actual content of the tweet! {{3}}
- **Hashtags**: A particular event or topic; always preceded by #, e.g. #rstats, #UNGA {{4}}
- **Links**: Embedded in the tweet; easy way to share information {{5}}
- **Media**: Pictures or videos {{6}}
- **Replies**: Similar to an SMS message but visible to the public. {{7}}
- **Retweets**: sharing somebody's tweet with your own network {{8}}
- **Favorites**: Keep track of liked content {{9}}
- **Geographical coordinates**: latitude/longitude {{10}}


`@script`
Despite the apparent simplicity of Twitter messages, the truth is that a simple tweet may carry a lot of information in itself.

## Retrieving past tweets

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "4807e7eb66"
```

`@part1`
Retrieving past tweets 
```r
shopify_tweets <- search_tweets(q = "#shopify",n = 1000, type="mixed")
```

- **q**: query used to filter and select tweets
- **n**: total number of tweets to return (default = 100)
- **type**: recent, popular or mixed (default = "recent")
- **include_rts**: include retweets? (default = TRUE)
- **geocode**: geographical limit (latitude, longitude, radius)
- **parse**: returns a parsed data frame (TRUE) or a nested list (FALSE)


`@script`
The search_tweets function provides an easy and highly customizable way to sift through the plethora of existing tweets by specifying a criterion of interest in the "query" parameter. This function also has several additional parameters that control what tweets are returned and how. Some of the most important parameters are:

## Retrieving new tweets (streaming)

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "13dc0a234b"
```

`@part1`
In a parsed data frame
```r
obama_tweets <- stream_tweets("Obama", timeout = 30)
```

In a JSON file for subsequent parsing
```r
stream_tweets("Obama", timeout = 30, parse=FALSE, file_name="obama")
obama_tweets <- parse_stream("obama.json")
```
Filter by geographical area
```r
stream_tweets("Obama", timeout = 30, parse=FALSE, file_name="obama")
usa <- stream_tweets(lookup_coords("usa"),timeout = 300)
usa2 <- stream_tweets(c(-125, 26, -65, 49), timeout = 300) # continental USA
```

## Examining Twitter data

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "4e4b0b3b29"
```

`@part1`
Explore the dimensions of the tweets dataframe
```r
dim(shopify_tweets)
```

What fields are available?
```r
names(shopify_tweets)
```

Peek at the data
```r
glimpse(shopify_tweets)
```


`@script`
Now that we have the Twitter data nicely parsed in a data frame, let us explore its dimensions, structure and take a quick look at the data.

## Exploratory analysis I

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "26b9796234"
```

`@part1`
How many of the tweets are quotes? 
```r
sum(shopify_tweets$is_quote)
```
How many are retweets?
```r
sum(shopify_tweets$is_retweet)
```

What is the average number of tweets per user?
```r
nrow(shopify_tweets) / length(unique(shopify_tweets$screen_name))
```


`@script`

## Exploratory Analysis II

```yaml
type: "TwoRows"
key: "d187330b0e"
```

`@part1`
What is the distribution of tweet lengths?
```r
ggplot(shopify_tweets, aes(display_text_width)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins=10) + 
  labs(title = "Distribution of tweet lengths") + 
  xlab("Tweet length")
```

## Exploratory Analysis III

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "cd09fa8e95"
```

`@part1`
What are the most frequent hashtags in Shopify tweets?
```r
all_hashtags = tolower(
unlist(shopify_tweets$hashtags))

data.frame(hashtag = all_hashtags) %>%
  count(hashtag) %>%
  filter(hashtag != 'shopify') %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  top_n(20) %>%
ggplot(aes(reorder(hashtag, n), n)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  geom_text(aes(label=n), hjust=0) +
  labs(x = "hashtag",
       y = "frequency",
       title = "Most frequent hashtags"
       )
```


`@part2`
![](http://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/3914/datasets/faacb628548022bb7c9bd25ef8825343f754efed/ch1-2-most-frequent-hashtags.png)


`@script`
Another interesting exploratory question is finding out which hashtags most often accompany the #shopify hashtag in people's tweets. These may provide strong indications of what the company is associated with. Let's do that now.

First, we take the hashtag field in each row and flatten them into a single list, then convert each hashtag to lowercase in order to avoid duplicates caused by different capitalizations of the same hashtag. We create a dataframe out of this list and invoke dplyr's magic to compute each hashtag's frequency, remove Shopify itself as hashtag, sort by frequency in descending order and retain the 20 most frequent hashtags. We then pass on the resultant dataframe to ggplot to create a horizontal bar plot and display each hashtag's frequency in our 1,000 Shopify tweet sample. The output of this series of operations is shown to the right. We can see that Shopify is often tagged along with terms like ecommerce, business, marketing, tech, entrepreneur or success. These are meaningful associations that reflect the company's mission and overall philosophy: make commerce better for everyone.

## Let's practice!

```yaml
type: "FinalSlide"
key: "8ffcd6edd4"
```

`@script`
You have been introduced to a lot of concepts in this lesson. Time to put them into practice with the exercises.
